# Description of lvs directors. Example:
#
#   lvs_director_groups:
#     - name: 'balancer80'
#       lvs_sched: 'rr'
#       lvs_method: 'DR'
#       port: 80
#       delay_loop: 2
#       persistence_timeout: 60
#       retry: 3
#       connect_timeout: 2
#       virtual_addresses:
#         - { address: 'VIP1' }
#         - { iface: 'ens3', address: 'VIP2/MASK' }
#       node_check: 'http_get'
#
# Addresses with `iface` _undefined_ will _not_ be added `network/interfaces`.
# On the other hand, addresses with defined `iface` will defined in
# `network/interfaces` using interface aliases starting at :100 . Using
# non-existent interface name will lead to ansible runtime error.
#
# Address format is 'IP/MASK'. CIDR prefix (mask) does not matter for LVS, but
# it'll be used when defining address in `network/interface`.
lvs_director_groups: []

# Description of lvs nodes. LVS group, where node is used, determined by
# `name`. Here `address` is real address of LVS node. The same note about
# addresses as above applies here.
#
# Example:
#
#   lvs_node_groups:
#     - name: 'balancer80'
#       address: 'RIP1/MASK'
#       iface: 'ens6'
#     - name: 'balancer443'
#       address: 'RIP2'
lvs_node_groups: []

# Description of vrrp instances. Note, that for `preempt_delay` to make sense,
# both instances intial state should be `BACKUP`. Example:
#
#   vrrp:
#     - instance: 'vr'
#       state:    'BACKUP'
#       priority: 255
#       vrid:     '55'
#       iface:    'ens3'
#       addresses:
#         - { address: 'VIP1' }
#       unicast_peer:
#         - IP3
#       lvs_sync_iface: 'ens6'
#       lvs_sync_id: 138
